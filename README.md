I am a data scientist with a strong background in computer science 💻 and experience in exploratory data analysis, machine learning, computer vision and statistics.

Passionate about data and excited to start my professional career in Data Science

🔭 I am currently finishing my specialized course in Data Science at the TripleTen BootCamp, ready to apply my knowledge and contribute to the world of data analysis. My previous training provides me with a solid quantitative foundation. 💪

🌱 I am honing my skills in key tools like Python 📘 and have already completed projects using advanced libraries like Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn.

I also have experience with SQL and data visualization tools such as Tableau and PowerBI. 🧑‍💻

I am fascinated by the challenge of deciphering patterns and trends in large volumes of data and transforming them into actionable insights that drive intelligent strategic decisions. 🕵️
